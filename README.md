What is Unity Linux

Unity Linux is a very small distribution, all things considered, if you even want to call it that. Unity Linux consists of a toolchain and a build root with packages and tools to create your very own Linux distribution, if need be, even from scratch.

What's the Purpose

Unity Linux itself is not meant to be ran as a full on Linux install, though it can be, it has a very select set of packages and tools for one general purpose and that is to build other packages. These select packages that Unity includes are deemed core packages and can be shared amongst distribution projects as a base. So in essence if Unity Linux was to be compared to a physical tree, it would be the root system (no pun intended, well maybe a little bit).

Status

Currently Unity Linux is in it's very early stages. We have core packages that are hosted on GitHub. Key packages to take note of would be: MUSL, OpenRC, BusyBox, RPM5, and YUM. At this point we do offer development ISOs that can be ran “live”, but not currently installed easily.
